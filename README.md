###  Overview:
         This repository contains a project developed as part of the ITI (Information Technology Institute) training program, 
         focusing on implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
         The project demonstrates the separation of concerns in a web application, with components organized into models, views, and controllers.


###  Day 11:
         - In this task we focuse on implementing the core components of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
         - specifically controllers and views.. This session introduces how to handle user requests, process input, and render dynamic content to the user interface.

         # Topics Covered:
             - ** Controllers **: 
                    - Creating controller classes to manage user interactions.
                    - Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST) and routing.
                    - Passing data between controllers and views.

             - ** Views **:
                     - Designing dynamic views using templating engines (e.g., Razor for ASP.NET MVC).
                     - Rendering data passed from controllers.
                     - Implementing layouts and partial views for reusable UI components.

             - ** Routing **:
                     - Configuring routes to map URLs to controller actions.

             - ** Hands-on Exercise **:
                     - Building a simple MVC application with a controller to handle user input and a view to display results.
                     - Example: Creating a form to collect user data and displaying it on a separate page.


 ###  Day 12:
           - In this task we focusing on models and database integration. This session covers how to define data models, 
             connect to a database, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within an MVC application.

           # Topics Covered:
                - ** Models **: 
                       - Defining data models to represent application entities (Employee , Department)
                       - Using data annotations for validation (e.g., [Required], [StringLength]).
                       - Defining generic repository pattern to manage entities of type T it is useful for CRUD operations.

                - ** Database Integration **: 
                       - Setting up a database context (e.g., Entity Framework for .NET).
                       - Configuring connection strings in the application.
                       - Performing migrations to create or update the database schema.

                - ** CRUD Operations **: 
                       - Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality in controllers.
                       - Displaying data in views using models.
                       
                - ** Hands-on Exercise **:  
                       - Building an MVC application with a model for a specific entity
                       - Example: Creating a company management system with add, view, edit, and delete features.
